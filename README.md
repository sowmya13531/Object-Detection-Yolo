# Object Detection with Yolov4(You Only Look Once) using OpenCV and Python
This repository demonstrates **object detection** using the **YOLOv4** (You Only Look Once) algorithm, implemented with **OpenCV** and **Python**. YOLOv4 is an improved version of YOLOv3 that provides faster and more accurate object detection in real-time.

## Project Overview
This project leverages **YOLOv4** to detect objects in images or videos. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a popular, state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm that divides an image into regions and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously.

### **Key Features**
- Real-time object detection with YOLOv4.
- OpenCV for image processing and object detection tasks.
- Detects multiple objects (e.g., people, cars, animals) in images or videos.

## Requirements
To get started with this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
  
# You can install the required dependencies using the following command:
``` pip install opencv-python-headless(Without GUI Support) ```

# YOLOv4 Model Files
This project uses the YOLOv4 model to perform object detection. You'll need to download the following files:
-->YOLOv4 Weights:
Download the pretrained YOLOv4 weights from <YOLOv4 Weights> (It is impossible to upload since it is 255MB,consider less memory size file.

-->YOLOv4 Config File:
Download the YOLOv4 config file from <YOLOv4 Config>.

-->Coco files:
Download coco files from coco.names. Pre-Trained Datasets Model

Once downloaded, place the yolov4.weights and yolov4.cfg files in the project root directory.

# Notebooks
object_detection.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook with code that demonstrates object detection using YOLOv4.

# In object_detection.ipynb we have 3 sub files as i uploaded seperately:
->Packages.txt [Packages to install initially]
->Image Detection.py[Program to run to detect Image] 
->Video Frames Detection.py[Program to run to detect Video]

# Datasets
-> I extracted Data {photos, Videos} normally from google and i took help from chatgpt to rectify my errors and doubts in project.

This is about my project Object Detection Using OpenCV and Python with YoloV4 Algorithm with Deeplearning and Machine Learning concepts.
